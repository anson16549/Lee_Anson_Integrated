# A website about "The Buffet Restaurant"

I created the restaurant website for my Final project, it is aiming for those people who live in Canada but are missing their home country's dishes. This restaurant's signature dishes are more prefer to Japanese, which is "Sushi". It's all you can eat!!! You can get as many as you want, if you can finish it!
